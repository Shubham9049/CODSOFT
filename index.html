          <h2>American Business Magnate</h2>
          <p>
            <b>Steven Paul Jobs (February 24, 1955 â€“ October 5, 2011) </b>was an
            American business magnate, inventor, and investor. He was the
            co-founder, chairman, and CEO of Apple; the chairman and majority
            shareholder of Pixar; a member of The Walt Disney Company's board of
            directors following its acquisition of Pixar; and the founder,
            chairman, and CEO of NeXT. He was a pioneer of the personal computer
            revolution of the 1970s and 1980s, along with his early business
            partner and fellow Apple co-founder Steve Wozniak.Jobs was born in
            San Francisco to a Syrian father and German-American mother. He was
            adopted shortly after his birth. Jobs attended Reed College in 1972
            before withdrawing that same year. In 1974, he traveled through
            India seeking enlightenment before later studying Zen Buddhism. He
            and Wozniak co-founded Apple in 1976 to sell Wozniak's Apple I
            personal computer. Together the duo gained fame and wealth a year
            later with production and sale of the Apple II, one of the first
            highly successful mass-produced microcomputers. Jobs saw the
            commercial potential of the Xerox Alto in 1979, which was
            mouse-driven and had a graphical user interface (GUI). This led to
            the development of the unsuccessful Apple Lisa in 1983, followed by
            the breakthrough Macintosh in 1984, the first mass-produced computer
            with a GUI. The Macintosh introduced the desktop publishing industry
            in 1985 with the addition of the Apple LaserWriter, the first laser
            printer to feature vector graphics.

          <h3>Innovations and designs</h3>
          <hr />
          <p>
            <b>Jobs's design aesthetic was influenced by philosophies of Zen and
                Buddhism. In India</b>, he experienced Buddhism while on his seven-month
            spiritual journey,and his sense of intuition was influenced by the
            spiritual people with whom he studied.He also learned from many
            references and sources, such as modernist architectural style of
            Joseph Eichler,[citation needed] and the industrial designs of
            Richard Sapper and Dieter Rams.[citation needed] According to Apple
            co-founder Steve Wozniak, "Steve didn't ever code. He wasn't an
            engineer and he didn't do any original design...".Daniel Kottke, one
            of Apple's earliest employees and a college friend of Jobs, stated:
            "Between Woz and Jobs, Woz was the innovator, the inventor. Steve
            Jobs was the marketing person." He is listed as either primary
            inventor or co-inventor in 346 United States patents or patent
            applications related to a range of technologies from actual computer
            and portable devices to user interfaces (including touch-based),
            speakers, keyboards, power adapters, staircases, clasps, sleeves,
            lanyards, and packages. His contributions to most of his patents
            were to "the look and feel of the product". He and his industrial
            design chief Jonathan Ive are named for 200 of the patents.Most of
            these are design patents as opposed to utility patents or
            inventions; they are specific product designs such as both original
            and lamp-style iMacs, and PowerBook G4 Titanium.He holds 43 issued
            US patents on inventions. The patent on the Mac OS X Dock user
            interface with "magnification" feature was issued the day before he
            died. Although Jobs had little involvement in the engineering and
            technical side of the original Apple computers, Jobs later used his
            CEO position to directly involve himself with product design.
            Involved in many projects throughout his career was his long-time
            marketing executive and confidant Joanna Hoffman, known as one of
            the few employees at Apple and NeXT who could successfully stand up
            to Jobs while also engaging with him. Even while terminally ill in
            the hospital, Jobs sketched new devices that would hold the iPad in
            a hospital bed. He despised the oxygen monitor on his finger, and
            suggested ways to revise the design for simplicity. Since his death,
            he has won 141 patents, more than most inventors during their
            lifetimes. He holds over 450 patents in total. <span><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steve_Jobs#Innovations_and_designs">Know more about Steve Jobs</a></span>
